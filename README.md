## 🍏 macOS Installation Instructions

### Step 1: Install Python 3

1.  Visit [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download **Python 3.14.0** (latest for macOS as of November 2025).
      * You should see a file named `'python-3.14.0-macos11.pkg'` or similar appear in your downloads folder.
2.  **Double-click** the installer file (`.pkg`) and follow the on-screen instructions.
      * It is generally recommended to **accept the default settings**, as they work well for most users. You may be prompted to enter your password.
3.  After the installation is complete, **open or restart** the **Terminal** application.
4.  Verify the installation by running the following command:
    ```bash
    python3 --version
    ```

Would you like me to continue correcting the formatting for the rest of the installation steps (e.g., Windows and Linux instructions, actual software installation)?
